Aim: To study and implement C++ decision making statements Loops

Software used: VS Code.

Theory: Loops in C++ are fundamental control structures used to execute a block of code repeatedly based on a condition. They enhance efficiency by reducing code redundancy and enabling dynamic runtime behavior. C++ supports three primary types of loops: for, while, and do-while.
- The for loop is ideal for counter-controlled iterations, where the number of repetitions is known. Its syntax includes initialization, condition, and update expressions, making it compact and readable for linear traversals, such as array indexing.

Syntax:
    
    for(initialization; condition; update) {
    // loop body
    }
- The while loop is condition-controlled and checks the condition before each iteration. It’s suitable for scenarios where the number of repetitions isn’t predetermined, like waiting for user input or monitoring sensor readings.

Syntax: 

    while(condition) {
    // loop body
    }
- The do-while loop is similar to while but guarantees at least one execution because the condition is checked after the loop body runs.

Syntax:

    do {
    // loop body
    } while(condition);

    
Loops may contain nested structures, break and continue statements for enhanced flow control, and are commonly paired with conditional statements to create complex decision logic. Mastery of loops is essential for solving problems related to iteration, searching, pattern generation, and data processing.
